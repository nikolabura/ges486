# Final Project

For my final project, I created a web app called FCCLE, the FCC Location Explorer (pronounced "fickle"; it's a little contrived, but it works).
The aim of this project was to load in data from the FCC Universal Licensing System database (specifically microwave radio data),
reprocess it into a useful format, and display it to be explored and interpreted in an interactive way online.

First things first. The web app can be accessed [via this link](http://umbcsad.crabdance.com/), or by clicking the fancy button below:
